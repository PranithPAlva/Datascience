<p>Later on we were quick run through the various programming concept of python</p>
<p>As we gained strong grip on basics we procceded to array manuplation with numpy as pandas</p>
<p>We were thought the use of numpy and pandas and how easy the make process of machine learning and the work of data scientist</p> 
<p>Then on the ending days of internship we made a case study on planet dataset from kaggle and covid data set from kaggle</p>
<p>We also determined the r2 score of diamond data set from kaggle where we used linear regression model to determine r2 score and importance of feature selection</p>

				<p>I learnt about importance of data, data extraction, processing and visualisation. I learnt about using various datasets and run the alogorithms to discover the data patterns
