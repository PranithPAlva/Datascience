<h5>About Mentor</h5>
<p>
We were mentored by Sohan sir.He was youngster like us,who is passoniate datascientist himself.His ability to present the concepts was remarkably good and his explanations were crystal clear. 
</p>		
<h5>Internship Journey:</h5>
			<p>
				The internship was on <em><strong>Python programming and Data Science</strong></em>. I learnt about Python software installation, environment setup followed by programming using basics and advanced concepts such as machine learning.
			</p>
<p>I learnt about importance of data, data extraction, processing and visualisation. I learnt about using various datasets and run the alogorithms to discover the data patterns
			</p>
<p>I learnt about stock market ,opening,closing and other domain,understood the customer requirements,importance of customer experience. I also represent and analyse GPU speed based on different factor</p>

			<p><b>DAY1:</b> we were taught how to set the environment and made familar with its functionality.</p>
<p><b>DAY2:</B>Later on we were quick run through the various programming concept of python such as datatypes,Variabels,processing strings,integers and floating points</p>
<p><b>DAY3:</b>Conditional Statements,looping statements,functions and lambda functions</p>
<p><b>DAY4:</B>Program based on the learnings of basic of python</p>
<p><b>DAY5:</B>Error handling,DocString and lists</p>
<p><b>DAY6:</B>Tupels and sets</p>
<p><b>DAY7-8:</B>Question based on lists and dictionaries</p>
<p><b>DAY9:</B>Introduction to numpy</p>
<p><b>DAY10:</B>Introduction to Pandas</p>
<p><b>DAY11:</B>Numpy and pandas practise</p>
<p><b>DAY12:</B>Working on dataset using numpy and pandas</p>
<p><b>DAY13:</B>Visualisation usin matplotlib and seaborne</p>
<p><b>DAY14:</B>Introduction to Mchine Learning (linear regression)</p>
<p><b>DAY15:</B>Dealing with null values and non null object in a dataset
We also determined the r2 score of diamond data set from kaggle where we used linear regression model to determine r2 score and importance of feature selection</p>
<h5>Learning Outcome</h5>
<p>
				I worked on proof of concept using Kaggle dataset to analyse and represent Car Dekho dataset to determine the prices for cars, Fish dataset to analyse the dimenions of fishes caught and computation.
			
				
			</p>
			
			<p>It was really knowledgable and great experience.Got to learn a lot of new things and get good grasp on various concepts and understand  industry standards.
